# Partner Profile Project

**Your Task:** You will be creating a _Profile Page_ similar to the one we just made for an actor. But this, time you're making a profile for **your partner**.

To start, you'll need to interview your partner and find out their:

1. Name
2. Nickname, title, or motto
2. Pop culture spirit animal (Leslie Knope? SpongeBob?); we'll feature a photo of that avatar
3. Top 3 books / shows / bands
4. Favorite website to waste time on
5. 3-sentence bio or mission statement
    * eg: "Joseph is a dreamer who is determined to set an example for his older brothers and younger sisters. As the first in his family to explore the world of code, Joseph plans to build websites that analyze the literary value of videogames as narrative vehicles."

## Requirements

Your website must include:
* Skeleton HTML (doctype, html, head, title, body)
* At least two header elements (h1, h3, etc.)
* At least one image
* At least one paragraph
* At least one anchor (a) element linking to another page

Remember to let us know when you make a mistake so we can add it to our error tally!
